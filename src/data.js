/*
taking control of our thoughts

our minds is the controlled tower of our life
all our decisions come from our mind
and what ever we are today today is the result of all we've been thinking those years

the Bible says as a man thinks in his heart so is he.

what determines what you think,
is it word of God, or is something i read or something you watch.

example the way people open their minds to a television program, either news, preaching, shows or something

not realizing they are being programmed in their minds to think a certain way.

So we need to engange our selves and watch shows or stuff that are going to program our minds
to think in the way God thinks. it includes watching sermons etc.

Col 3:1-8

So when some one is born again or baptised its as if youve died to your old way of life
and youve rose to walk in a newness of life. So its says we should keep seeking thinks from above.
Spiritual things. Set your mind on the things above not on the things on earth.

Things that are holy righteaous, good and help full. 

2. Challenge in controlling our thought
2nd corin 4:4, 11:3.
so if satan is going to fight you. it will be in your mind.

bacasue who your are or who youre going to be starts from your mind.
the way your thiink. what you think about yourself, what you think about others.

So sometimes satan will make you recall thinks that have happedn long ago
things that were bad and we dwell opon it and start feeling bad. so if our minds isnt field with
the word of GOd, with good things, we suffer the consequences of what we thought about.

So we should keep feeding our minds with the word of God. becasue what ever we put in our minds
is going to stay
forever unless we are delivered from it.

So our lifes is the expression of our thinking. so if we dont like the way things are going we should
changes our thinking.

so if you're angry try and lay it down, if youre feeling jealous try and lay it down.

So christains who have the Holy Spirit living in us.

and he is a helper to us, he enables us to think the right way he brings God to our minds.
so we should learn to always be in communiion with the holy spirit

because He is the one going to remind us to always think right.

we sow thought and reap and action,
we sow and action and reap a habit
we sow a habit and reap a character
we sow character and reap a destiny
